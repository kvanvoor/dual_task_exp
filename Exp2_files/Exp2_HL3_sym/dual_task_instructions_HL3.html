Instructions
</h2>
  
  <p>
Each trial is comprised of two tasks.  One task is to store letters (which we will present to you) in memory so that, at the end of each trial, you can type these out in BACKWARDS order. So, if you receive T, followed by a K and a B, you will then be asked later to type in BKT.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, while you are storing the letters, you will be shown a picture of 4 dice along with a statement.
    You will be asked to determine to what extent you agree (yes) or disagree (no) with the statement that describes the picture
    by selecting a point on a scale.
    We will provide a short training so that you can become familiar with the task.
</p>
  
  
    <p>
   <b>It is important that you correctly answer the memory task, so please stay focused during the presentation of the letters!</b>
