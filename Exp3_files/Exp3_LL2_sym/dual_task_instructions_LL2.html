Instructions
</h2>
  
  <p>
Each trial is comprised of two tasks.  One task is to store letters (which we will present to you) in memory so that, at the end of each trial, you can type these out. So, if you receive T, followed by a K, you will then be asked later to type in TK.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, while you are storing the letters, you will be shown a picture along with a statement.
    You will be asked to determine whether you agree or disagree with the statement that describes the picture
    by pressing "F" (Disagree) or "J" (Agree) on your keyboard.
    We will provide a short training so that you can become familiar with the task.
</p>
  
  
    <p>
   <b>It is important that you correctly answer the memory task, so please stay focused during the presentation of the letters!</b>
